# ACCESS Artifacts
This repo tracts recurrent artifacts that we observe in MSK-ACCESS data

# There are three different folders for each variant type
- Small variants
- Structural variants
- Copy number variants

**Note**: *The list will be used to remove recurrent artifacts seen in access data to facilitate the access_data_analysis process for the research project review.*
